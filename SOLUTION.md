## Reflection Questions

### 1. Why use groups instead of attaching policies directly to users?

**Your Answer:**

It is easier to manage and scale beacuse you can edit permissions for multuple users at once. Is more time efficient and also allows less room for human error.

---

### 2. What are the risks of giving everyone AdministratorAccess?

**Your Answer:**

There are security risks as users would have full admin access so they could create instances leading to unexpected costs, steal access keys if they leave the company. Also in-experienced users could accidentally change things and it cannot be traced or rolled back. 

---

### 3. How would you organize IAM for 50 developers across 5 projects?

**Your Answer:**

I would create individual IAMs for each user then create project based & role based groups to manage permissions effectively. There would then be seperate groups for different permission levels.

---

### 4. What happens if you delete an IAM user? Can you recover their permissions?

**Your Answer:**

No, deletion is permananent. Permissions can be recreated but history is lost. They can be re added to the correct groups.

---

## Key Learnings

**What was most challenging about this lab?**

Knowing the different IAM components and what they're used for      

---

**What IAM best practice will you always follow?**

Every user gets their own IAM and has to change password and enable MFA. Also creating groups for easy and scaleable permission management.

---

**How does IAM help implement the principle of least privilege?**
It gives users only the permissions needed to do their job and nothing more.
